### Automating the analysis of first binary formation in core collapse ###
This repository contains all the code and scripts for my bachelor research project. The Python code for simulating core collapse in a "globular" cluster of 1000 stars is based on a script (see initial commit) my supervisor had lying around somewhere.

To run it, you first need to install [AMUSE](https://amusecode.org/) and its prerequisites, and make. Then make sure you are in the AMUSE virtual environment (if you created it) and execute `make run` in the root directory of the repo.
